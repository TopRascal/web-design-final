                Minecraft: Java Edition is the original version of Minecraft released all the way back in 2010 for the PC. If you have Minecraft on your computer at home, it is very likely that this is the version you have. Features it has over Bedrock Edition include:

                Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is a version of the game created long after its original release on PC, and after its developers, Mojang, being acquired by Microsoft.

                <li>Superior Optimization than Java</li>
