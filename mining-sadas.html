        A large part of any Minecraft player's life is searching for the valuable ores that open up a whole new world of tools, weapons, and resources. Whether it's as simple as powering your furnace, or supplying an entire house with automatic doors and lanterns, being able to know where to find these ores (and how to get them) is essential to mastering this creative game. It's okay. We did the searching for you. So here's our guide on where to find all the valuable ores in Minecraft.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Where to find all the ores in Minecraft:</h2>
    <img src="images/mining/mining_image2.jpg">
    <p>
        There are a total of 8 different ores currently available in Minecraft, all with varying levels of rarity. These ores appear in veins of different sizes, and some of these ores can only be found in specific locations. Knowing where to look to find your ores and how to mine them efficiently is most of the battle.

        Minecraft generates worlds by numbering each block, with the bottommost level of bedrock being labeled as block 0, and each subsequent block afterward raising that number by one. This includes bedrock, air, and basically everything in between. Knowing this, it becomes much easier to know where to go to find ores. Minecraft considers sea level to be at block 62, and clouds start generating at block 128. Most ores are found below sea level, and no ores will be found above cloud level.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Coal:</h2>
    <img src="images/mining/mining_coal1.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>What depth is coal found at? <em>Between blocks 5 and blocks 128.</em></li>
        <li>Where is coal found at? <em>Every biome in the Overworld.</em></li>
        <li>Can coal be condensed? <em>Yes, with nine pieces of coal.</em></li>
        <li>Does coal need to be smelted? <em>No, coal does the smelting.</em></li>
        <li>What tool do you need? <em>Wooden pickaxe or greater.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Coal is by far the most common ore, to the point that most veteran Minecraft players will genuinely ignore coal after a certain point in the game. While extremely useful, it is very easy to build up a large amount of coal relatively quickly. Coal is used primarily to power furnaces and to craft torches, so it's handy to find early on in the game. Coal is prevalent in every biome in the Overworld and is the only ore that can be regularly found above sea level, meaning you'll even find this common resource inside mountains. It also generates in huge veins, so players can often get nearly entire stacks of coal from a single spot.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Iron:</h2>
    <img src="images/mining/mining_iron1.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>What depth is iron found at? <em>Between blocks 5 and blocks 64.</em></li>
        <li>Where is iron found at? <em>Every biome in the Overworld.</em></li>
        <li>Can iron be condensed? <em>Yes, with nine iron ingots.</em></li>
        <li>Does iron need to be smelted? <em>Yes, iron ore is smelted into iron ingots.</em></li>
        <li>What tool do you need? <em>Stone pickaxe or greater.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Iron is arguably the most useful of all the ores in Minecraft, because of its importance early on in the game, its accessibility, its many varied uses, and the fact that it can't be substituted like coal can with charcoal. It is used to make anything from weapons, tools, armor, rails, buckets, and much more. Iron is the second most numerous ore found in Minecraft, so players later in the game will likely have chests full of the stuff. You can never have too much iron, though, since it never entirely ceases to be useful to build cost-efficient tools that still get the job done every time. Iron can generate in veins as much as 12 to 20 blocks of ore in a vein but more commonly generates in groups of 4 to 6.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Gold:</h2>
    <img src="images/mining/mining_gold1.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>What depth is gold found at? <em>Between blocks 5 and blocks 29, or blocks 80 in badlands.</em></li>
        <li>Where is gold found at? <em>Every biome in the Overworld, but especially badlands.</em></li>
        <li>Can gold be condensed? <em>Yes, with nine gold ingots.</em></li>
        <li>Does gold need to be smelted? <em>Yes, gold ore is smelted into gold ingots.</em></li>
        <li>What tool do you need? <em>Iron pickaxe or greater.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Gold has limited use to players early on in the game due to is frailty in use in weapons, tools, and armor. However, late-game players will recognize its value in redstone contraptions, clocks, and the crafting of powerful food items like golden apples. Gold is a frequent reward in chests found in strongholds, dungeons, abandoned mines, and the Nether, but can also be mined. It's definitely worth grabbing when you see it because gold is relatively rare in the game. Minecraft is also planning a major update to the Nether that will add new mobs and a new trading system heavily involving gold. In a badlands biome, gold can actually be found above ground and in exposed abandoned mineshafts, up to blocks 80. It's one of the rarer ores in the game, found typically in veins ranging from 2 to 4 ore blocks.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Redstone:</h2>
    <img src="images/mining/mining_redstone1.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>What depth is redstone found at? <em>Between blocks 5 and blocks 15.</em></li>
        <li>Where is redstone found at? <em>Every biome in the Overworld.</em></li>
        <li>Can redstone be condensed? <em>Yes, with nine pieces of redstone.</em></li>
        <li>Does redstone need to be smelted? <em> No, redstone only needs to be mined.</em></li>
        <li>What tool do you need? <em>Iron pickaxe or greater.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Redstone is an ore that very quickly takes up inventory space for players who weren't looking for it but is invaluable to Minecraft players who are invested in its use. Used in a nearly infinite number of machines, contraptions, and more, redstone is the equivalent of electrical wiring in Minecraft. It's necessary for almost anything that moves and is important for any player looking to make their operations more efficient or their builds more advanced. Redstone spawns in relatively large veins, and a single block of redstone ore drops multiple bits of redstone at a time, rather than just one.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Lapis Lazuli:</h2>
    <img src="images/mining/mining_lapis1.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>What depth is lapis lazuli found at? <em>Between blocks 14 and blocks 23.</em></li>
        <li>Where is lapis lazuli found at? <em>Every biome in the Overworld.</em></li>
        <li>Can lapis lazuli be condensed? <em>Yes, with nine pieces of lapis lazuli.</em></li>
        <li>Does lapis lazuli need to be smelted? <em> No, lapis lazuli only needs to be mined.</em></li>
        <li>What tool do you need? <em>Stone pickaxe or greater.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Lapis lazuli has a strange name and a rather limited number of uses but is still valuable to have around and a necessity if you want to power up in Minecraft. Its more mundane use is in crafting blue dye, but more importantly, lapis lazuli is a crucial ingredient in enchanting all of your equipment. Every enchantment requires a bit of lapis lazuli to finalize, so this ore is one you won't want to pass by lightly. Lapis lazuli actually generates in a similar fashion to redstone, in decently sized veins that drop multiple bits of lapis lazuli with each block mined. That also means you can find your inventory taken up predominantly by lapis lazuli in a moment, so condensing it down as you go is never a bad idea.
